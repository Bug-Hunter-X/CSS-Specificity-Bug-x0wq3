The solution involves either modifying the class selector to have higher specificity (e.g., by adding an ID selector), or restructuring the CSS to avoid conflicts.  Using more specific selectors (like IDs) is generally a cleaner solution in cases where specificity conflicts occur.  Alternatively, using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged for its potential to create future maintainability issues) can also resolve the issue, but it should be used sparingly.
